# Custom Neural Network Architecture from Scratch
**Implementation of Multi-Layer Perceptron using NumPy for Clinical Data Classification**

## 🩺 Clinical Context
This project demonstrates the mathematical foundations of Artificial Intelligence in medicine. By building a neural network without high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, this implementation ensures a deep understanding of the optimization logic required for sensitive medical datasets.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Pure NumPy:** Manual implementation of forward and backward propagation.
- **Optimization:** Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with weight updates.
- **Evaluation:** Rigorous testing using **5-fold and 10-fold Cross-Validation** to ensure model stability and generalizability.
- **Metrics:** Tracked Mean Squared Error (MSE) across various learning rates (0.01 to 0.0001).

## 📊 Results
Achieved stable convergence across multiple architectural settings, proving the efficacy of the custom gradient descent logic on normalized medical features.
