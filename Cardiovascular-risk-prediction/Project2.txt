Steps to Run

1. ‘Open Google Colab’: Go to [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. ‘Upload Notebook’: In the menu, go to `File` > `Upload notebook...` and select `project2.ipynb` file.

3. ‘Upload Dataset’:
    - Click on the ‘folder icon’ in the left sidebar to open the file explorer.
    - Click the "Upload to session storage" button (looks like a page with an upward arrow).
     Select dataset file (`framingham.csv`).

4.  ‘Run the Code’: Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially from top to bottom. You can do this by clicking the "play" button next to each cell or by selecting `Runtime` > `Run all` from the menu.
