# 10-Year Cardiovascular Disease (CHD) Risk Assessment
**Logistic Regression for Preventative Healthcare**

## 🩺 Clinical Context
Identifying patients at high risk for heart disease allows for early intervention. This project translates classic medical risk factors into a predictive probability score.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression (Scikit-Learn).
- **Data Engineering:** Missing value imputation for clinical biomarkers and feature scaling.
- **Validation:** Evaluated via **Confusion Matrix** and **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-Score) to ensure a low false-negative rate, which is critical in healthcare.

## 📊 Clinical Impact
The model serves as a screening tool to prioritize high-risk patients for further diagnostic cardiac evaluation.
